\## Performance and Optimization Strategies



Achieving low latency (targeting sub-200ms) and high throughput is essential for real-time usability in Globule.



\### Latency Benchmarks



\- \*\*CPU Performance:\*\* On modern CPUs (e.g., Ryzen 9 7900X3D), Ollama embeddings range from 200–300ms per document. Sub-200ms is challenging without optimization, often taking minutes for large texts (e.g., 100-page document ~15 minutes on CPU).

\- \*\*GPU Performance:\*\* GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) reduce latency drastically, embedding short sentences in hundreds of milliseconds. A 120KB text file took ~1 hour on an i7-9850H CPU but could approach sub-200ms for tiny inputs with top-tier GPUs and FP16 precision.



\### Optimization Techniques



\- \*\*GPU Acceleration:\*\* GPUs offer 10-25x speedups over CPUs. A mid-tier RTX 3060 can index 10,000 files efficiently, while high-end GPUs (H100) yield marginal gains unless batch sizes are maximized.

\- \*\*Quantization:\*\* INT8 or Q4\_0 quantization provides 3-4x performance gains with minimal quality loss, critical for memory-bound tasks.

\- \*\*Batch Processing:\*\* Embedding multiple texts in one request (e.g., 10–100 documents) amortizes overhead, doubling throughput on GPUs. Example:

&nbsp; ```bash

&nbsp; curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/embed -d '{"model": "mxbai-embed-large", "input": \["Text 1", "Text 2"]}'

&nbsp; ```

\- \*\*Caching:\*\* Store embeddings for frequent inputs in memory (e.g., Redis) to avoid recomputation, cutting latency significantly.



\### Hardware Considerations



\- \*\*Memory:\*\* `mxbai-embed-large` needs 2-3GB RAM/VRAM, while `all-minilm` fits in 400MB. Larger models (70B) require 40GB+ VRAM.

\- \*\*Thread Management:\*\* Set `num\_thread` to physical CPU cores for optimal CPU use, and adjust `OLLAMA\_NUM\_PARALLEL` (default 4) for concurrency.



\## Integration Architecture with Ollama



Ollama’s local API is the backbone of Globule’s Embedding Service, ensuring privacy and low latency.



\### API Usage



\- \*\*Endpoint:\*\* Use `/api/embed` for embeddings:

&nbsp; ```bash

&nbsp; curl http://localhost:11434/api/embed -d '{"model": "mxbai-embed-large", "input": "Sample text", "keep\_alive": "30m"}'

&nbsp; ```

&nbsp; Returns a JSON with an `"embeddings"` array of floats.

\- \*\*Python Example:\*\*

&nbsp; ```python

&nbsp; import ollama

&nbsp; response = ollama.embed(model="mxbai-embed-large", input="Sample text")

&nbsp; vector = response\["embeddings"]

&nbsp; ```



\### Error Handling and Parallelization



\- \*\*Timeouts:\*\* Set reasonable timeouts (e.g., 120s) and retry with exponential backoff for transient errors.

\- \*\*Multiple Instances:\*\* Run Ollama on different ports (e.g., 11434, 11435) per GPU using `CUDA\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES`, with a load balancer for distribution.

\- \*\*Monitoring:\*\* Use `/api/version` for health checks and `ollama ps` for resource usage.



\## Fallback Strategies and Resilience



Ensuring uninterrupted service is critical for production reliability.



\- \*\*Hugging Face API:\*\* Primary fallback with higher latency (~2s) and costs, supporting diverse models.

\- \*\*Local Sentence-Transformers:\*\* Offline backup via `SentenceTransformer(local\_path)`, requiring pre-downloaded models.

\- \*\*Consistency:\*\* Standardize outputs across providers to maintain search integrity.

\- \*\*Circuit Breakers:\*\* Implement three-state logic (Closed, Open, Half-Open) to degrade gracefully to cached responses.



\## Vector Dimensionality and Storage



Managing vector sizes and storage is key to scalability.



\- \*\*Dimensionality:\*\* Varies by model (e.g., 1024 for `mxbai-embed-large`, 384 for `all-minilm`). Store as BLOBs in SQLite with metadata.

\- \*\*Reduction Techniques:\*\*

&nbsp; - \*\*Truncation:\*\* Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) retains 93% performance with 12x compression.

&nbsp; - \*\*PCA:\*\* Reduces dimensions (e.g., 1024 to 512) while preserving variance.

&nbsp; - \*\*Quantization:\*\* Float8 or int8 cuts storage by 4-8x with <0.3% quality loss.



\## Content Preprocessing



Preprocessing ensures content is embedding-ready.



\- \*\*Chunking:\*\* Split texts into 128-512 token chunks with 10-20% overlap (e.g., 100 tokens). Use sentence boundaries or sliding windows.

\- \*\*Extraction:\*\* Use OCR for images/PDFs and speech-to-text for audio.

\- \*\*Normalization:\*\* Remove URLs, standardize encoding (UTF-8), and preserve domain terms.



\## Quality Assurance and Monitoring



Maintaining embedding quality and service health is essential.



\- \*\*Benchmarks:\*\* Evaluate with MTEB; `mxbai-embed-large` achieves SOTA.

\- \*\*Similarity Testing:\*\* Verify cosine similarity for known pairs (e.g., "dog" vs. "puppy").

\- \*\*Drift Detection:\*\* Use KL divergence or PSI; re-embed if thresholds (e.g., PSI > 0.2) are exceeded.

\- \*\*Metrics:\*\* Track latency, throughput, error rates, and resource usage (e.g., VRAM via `nvidia-smi`).



\## Caching and Incremental Updates



Efficiency hinges on minimizing redundant work.



\- \*\*Caching:\*\* Store chunk-level embeddings in Redis or memory; reuse via input hashes.

\- \*\*Updates:\*\* Re-embed only changed chunks, detected via hashes or timestamps.



\## Special Content Types



Globule’s versatility grows with multimodal support.



\- \*\*Images:\*\* Use CLIP for unified text-image embeddings.

\- \*\*Audio:\*\* Transcribe, then embed text with standard models.

\- \*\*Code:\*\* Employ CodeBERT for semantic code understanding.



\## Resource Management



Hardware constraints shape deployment.



\- \*\*RAM/VRAM:\*\* Large models need 2-3GB (e.g., `mxbai-embed-large`), scalable with quantization.

\- \*\*Queuing:\*\* Limit concurrent requests (e.g., 100-200 connections) to prevent overload.

\- \*\*Scaling:\*\* Use horizontal (multiple instances) or vertical (better hardware) scaling.



\## Operational Best Practices



Robust operations ensure reliability.



\- \*\*API Design:\*\* Align with OpenAI standards; document endpoints clearly.

\- \*\*Rate Limiting:\*\* Use sliding window or token bucket to manage load.

\- \*\*Retry Logic:\*\* Implement exponential backoff for transient failures.

\- \*\*Monitoring:\*\* Set alerts for latency spikes, errors, or drift via tools like Prometheus.
