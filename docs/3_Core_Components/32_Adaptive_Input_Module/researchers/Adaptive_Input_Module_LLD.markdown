# Low-Level Design for the Adaptive Input Module

This document provides a detailed Low-Level Design (LLD) for the Adaptive Input Module of the Globule system, based on the provided documentation and best practices. The module serves as the conversational gateway, validating user inputs, detecting input types, applying schemas, and ensuring a seamless user experience. The design addresses nine key areas: user experience, schema detection, configuration, technical architecture, integration, edge cases, performance, user research, and testing.

## 1. User Experience & Interaction Design

### 3-Second Auto-Confirmation Mechanism
The 3-second auto-confirmation mechanism should use a visual countdown timer or progress bar to indicate the time remaining before automatic confirmation, ensuring users are aware of the action. In the command-line interface (CLI), a message like "[Press Enter to confirm, 'n' to correct, or wait 3 seconds for auto-confirm]" provides clear feedback. For rapid successive inputs, such as paste operations, the system queues inputs and processes them sequentially to prevent overlap, maintaining responsiveness. In a graphical user interface (GUI), a subtle animation or highlight can reinforce the timer’s visibility. This approach aligns with the High-Level Design’s emphasis on minimal friction (Section 5.1).

### Balancing Conversational Helpfulness
To balance helpfulness without being intrusive, the module offers configurable verbosity levels (silent, concise, verbose, debug), adjustable via CLI flags or configuration files (e.g., `globule --verbosity=concise add "input"`). Feedback is action-oriented, using concise prompts like "Input detected as a prompt. Confirm?" to guide users efficiently. The system avoids overwhelming users by limiting unnecessary details in lower verbosity modes, as noted in the High-Level Design’s configurable verbosity feature (Section 5.6). Users can toggle verbosity contextually based on their familiarity or task complexity.

### Clarifying Ambiguous Inputs
Ambiguous inputs, such as "review this," are clarified through schema-driven prompts that request specific information, like "What type of review (e.g., task, note)?" The system presents a short list of possible schema matches based on detected patterns, allowing users to select the correct one with minimal effort. This approach, supported by the High-Level Design’s schema detection (Section 5.7), ensures quick resolution without frustrating users. For example, a URL without context might trigger a prompt like "Why save this link?" to gather intent.

### Visual or Auditory Cues for Schema Application
In a GUI, visual cues like highlighted text or tooltips indicate the detected schema, making the process intuitive. In the CLI, color-coded text or symbols (e.g., green for confirmed schemas) provide clarity, as implied by the Transparency Suite (High-Level Design, Section 7.2). Auditory cues, such as subtle beeps for accessibility, can signal successful detection or the need for clarification. Users can inspect schema decisions via a "details" command, showing confidence scores or matched triggers, ensuring transparency.

### Correcting or Overriding Schema Detection
Users can correct schema detection using simple CLI commands like ‘n’ (no) to reject a schema or ‘e’ (edit) to modify it, as shown in the High-Level Design’s conversational contract (Section 5.1). In a GUI, dropdown menus or buttons allow quick selection of alternative schemas. The system learns from corrections to improve future detections, reducing workflow disruptions. User-defined schemas, supported by the Schema Engine (Component Shopping List, Section 8), enable tailored detection without extensive navigation.

## 2. Schema Detection & Application

### Detection Strategies
The module prioritizes a hybrid approach: fast pattern matching for simple inputs (e.g., URLs with "http://") and ML-based methods, particularly large language models (LLMs), for complex inputs like sentiment analysis, as described in the Technical Architecture (Section 5.3). Pattern matching ensures efficiency for common cases, while ML enhances accuracy for nuanced inputs, such as detecting sarcasm (High-Level Design, Section 7.1). This combination balances speed and precision, aligning with the system’s performance goals.

### Predictable Schema Application
To ensure predictability, the module displays matched triggers or previews of how inputs will be processed, such as showing the suggested file path (e.g., "~/globule/work/frustrations/meeting-overload.md"). The Transparency Suite allows users to inspect AI decisions, including confidence scores, as noted in the High-Level Design (Section 7.2). This transparency builds trust and allows users to anticipate outcomes, reducing surprises.

### Confidence Thresholds
Confidence thresholds for automatic schema application should be set high (e.g., >0.9) to ensure accuracy, with lower thresholds (e.g., <0.5) triggering user prompts for clarification, based on common ML practices. Scores between 0.5 and 0.9 can suggest a schema but require confirmation, as implied by the Technical Architecture’s domain detection confidence scores (Section 5.2). These thresholds should be tuned through user testing to balance automation and control.

### Handling Multiple Applicable Schemas
When multiple schemas apply, the module presents a ranked list of options based on confidence scores, allowing users to select the correct one via a simple command or GUI selection. Alternatively, it can apply the highest-confidence schema and offer an override option, as supported by the High-Level Design’s correction mechanisms (Section 5.1). This ensures flexibility without overwhelming users with choices.

### Trade-offs Between Detection Speed and Accuracy
Achieving a <5ms detection speed requires fast pattern matching for simple schemas, which may sacrifice accuracy for complex inputs. ML-based detection, while more accurate, may exceed 5ms due to computational overhead, as noted in the Technical Architecture’s performance targets (Section 6). The module should use a tiered approach: quick pattern matching for obvious cases and ML for ambiguous inputs, ensuring both speed and accuracy are optimized where possible.

## 3. Configuration & Customization

### Verbosity Levels
Verbosity levels (silent, concise, verbose, debug) are implemented as settings in the Configuration System, adjustable via CLI flags (e.g., `globule --verbosity=verbose`) or YAML files (Component Shopping List, Section 7). Contextual toggling can be based on user behavior or input complexity, such as increasing verbosity for frequent corrections. The system stores these settings locally, ensuring quick access and user control.

### Implicit Learning of User Preferences
The module can implicitly learn preferences by tracking user corrections and interactions, adjusting confidence thresholds or default schemas accordingly. For example, frequent overrides of a schema can lower its priority, as implied by the Orchestration Engine’s adaptation (High-Level Design, Section 5.1). Reinforcement learning techniques can refine this process, ensuring the system aligns with user habits over time.

### Overriding Schemas for Power Users
Power users can override schemas using commands like `globule add --schema=link_curation "input"`, as supported by user-defined schemas (High-Level Design, Section 5.7). In a GUI, a dropdown or input field allows manual schema selection. These options are designed for minimal friction, enabling quick overrides without navigating complex menus.

### Three-Tier Configuration Cascade
The three-tier cascade (system defaults, user preferences, context overrides) is implemented via the Configuration System using YAML files, with methods like `load_cascade()` and `get_setting()` (Component Shopping List, Section 7). System defaults ensure zero-config usability, user preferences allow personalization, and context overrides enable dynamic adaptation. This structure ensures flexibility across components, with settings accessible via a unified interface.

### Privacy Safeguards
User-configured settings are stored locally on the device, encrypted to protect sensitive data, aligning with the Vision and Strategy’s privacy-first principle (Section 6). Clear documentation and interfaces allow users to manage settings, ensuring transparency. No data is transmitted externally without explicit consent, complying with privacy best practices.

## 4. Technical Architecture

### Pipeline Design for Extensibility
The module uses a plugin architecture with `DomainPlugin` and `ParserPlugin` classes, allowing new input types to be added dynamically without modifying core code (Technical Architecture, Section 5.4). This ensures extensibility for future input types, such as voice or images, by registering new plugins.

### Asynchronous Processing
Asynchronous processing is implemented using Python’s `asyncio`, with tasks like schema detection and parsing running in parallel to maintain responsiveness (Technical Architecture, Section 5.3). The `process_globule` function exemplifies this, ensuring non-blocking operation even under load.

### State Management for Conversational Interactions
State is managed using the `Globule` data structure, which captures input details and processing results (Technical Architecture, Section 4). For multi-step conversational interactions, a session identifier or state machine can track context, linking related inputs to maintain conversation flow, though specific mechanisms are not detailed in the documentation.

### Error-Handling Strategies
Error handling includes input validation to catch invalid inputs early, asynchronous error catching to manage task failures, and cross-validation to ensure data consistency (Technical Architecture, Section 5.3). Try-except blocks and logging ensure disruptions like network timeouts are handled gracefully, preventing system crashes.

### Communicating Errors to Users
Errors are communicated via clear, non-disruptive messages, such as "Invalid input, please re-enter" in the CLI, with options to retry or correct (High-Level Design, Section 5.1). In a GUI, pop-ups or notifications guide users without breaking their flow, ensuring a smooth experience.

## 5. Integration Points

### Schema Engine Integration
The module integrates with the Schema Engine by querying it for schema detection and caching frequently used schemas in memory for speed (Component Interaction Flows, Step 1). Hot-reloading is implemented by monitoring schema files for changes, updating the cache without restarting the system.

### Handoff to Orchestration Engine
The module passes an `EnrichedInput` object to the Orchestration Engine, containing raw input, detected schema, and metadata in a structured format like JSON or a Python object (Component Interaction Flows, Step 1). This ensures seamless enrichment by downstream components.

### Configuration Alignment
Configuration settings are aligned across components by querying the Configuration System, which manages the three-tier cascade (Component Shopping List, Section 7). This ensures consistent settings application, with context-specific overrides taking precedence.

### APIs or Interfaces
Real-time communication uses direct function calls or an in-memory message bus, given the local-first design (Technical Architecture, Section 5). A publish-subscribe pattern can decouple components if needed, ensuring scalability.

### Non-Text Input Support
The module supports future non-text inputs via the Input Router, which directs inputs like voice or images to appropriate processors (Technical Architecture, Section 5.1). Plugins can be added for speech-to-text or image recognition, ensuring extensibility.

## 6. Edge Cases & Special Scenarios

### Rapid Successive Inputs
Rapid inputs are handled by queuing them for sequential processing, with rate limiting to prevent overload (Technical Architecture, Section 5.1). Feedback is provided for each input to maintain user awareness, ensuring no data loss.

### Security Measures
Security includes input size limits to prevent buffer overflows and sanitization to block malicious patterns, such as script injections (Technical Architecture, Section 6). Regular expression filters can detect suspicious inputs, enhancing safety.

### Future Non-Text Inputs
The module prepares for non-text inputs by leveraging the plugin architecture, allowing new processors for voice (speech-to-text) or images (OCR/image recognition) (Technical Architecture, Section 5.4). The Input Router directs these inputs appropriately.

### Ambiguous or Incomplete Inputs
Ambiguous inputs trigger brief, schema-driven prompts to clarify intent, such as asking for context or presenting schema options (High-Level Design, Section 5.1). This minimizes user frustration by keeping interactions concise.

### Unsupported Input Types
For unsupported inputs, the module informs users via clear messages (e.g., "Input type not supported, try text input") and suggests alternatives, logging the attempt for future feature consideration (Technical Architecture, Section 5.1).

## 7. Performance Requirements

### Latency Budgets
Latency budgets of <5ms for schema detection and <100ms for total processing are realistic for local-first systems using optimized pattern matching and lightweight ML models (Technical Architecture, Section 6). These targets ensure a responsive user experience on modern hardware.

### Resource Usage Optimization
Resource usage is optimized with Least Recently Used (LRU) caches for schemas and efficient data structures to minimize memory footprint (Technical Architecture, Section 5). Avoiding redundant computations further reduces CPU usage.

### Profiling Techniques
Profiling uses tools like Python’s cProfile to measure function timings, alongside monitoring CPU/memory usage and load testing with simulated inputs (Technical Architecture, Section 7). Continuous integration ensures performance targets are met.

### Performance Trade-offs
Simple schema detection prioritizes speed via pattern matching, while complex detection uses ML for accuracy, accepting slight latency increases (Technical Architecture, Section 5.3). A tiered approach optimizes both aspects based on input complexity.

### Performance Metrics
Metrics include average/95th percentile latency, throughput (inputs per second), resource usage (CPU, memory, disk), error rates, and user satisfaction scores, ensuring real-world performance aligns with goals (Technical Architecture, Section 7).

## 8. User Research Questions

### Mental Models for Categorizing Thoughts
Users likely categorize thoughts by purpose, such as tasks, notes, ideas, or questions, expecting the system to recognize and organize them accordingly (Vision and Strategy, Section 2). The module should support these categories through flexible schemas.

### Workflow Integration
Users expect CLI integration with simple commands, scriptable automation, and compatibility with tools like text editors or note-taking apps (Vision and Strategy, Section 4). File syncing or API support can enhance integration.

### Onboarding Strategies
Onboarding includes tutorials, example use cases, and progressive disclosure to introduce features gradually (Vision and Strategy, Section 4). Contextual help and tooltips ensure new users find the module intuitive.

### Automation vs. Control
Users appreciate automation that saves time but want control over schema decisions, achieved through transparent detection and easy overrides (Vision and Strategy, Section 3.4). This balance enhances user trust and agency.

### Pain Points in Corrections
Pain points include repeated corrections, unclear prompts, or workflow interruptions (High-Level Design, Section 5.1). The module mitigates these by learning from corrections, using clear prompts, and minimizing clarification frequency.

## 9. Testing & Validation Strategy

### Usability Tests
Usability tests involve task-based evaluations (e.g., capturing inputs, correcting schemas) and observational studies to assess intuitiveness, supplemented by user surveys for feedback (Vision and Strategy, Section 7). These validate the conversational interface’s effectiveness.

### Performance Benchmarks
Benchmarks simulate real-world usage, measuring latency and resource usage with tools like cProfile and load testing scripts (Technical Architecture, Section 7). Automated tests ensure consistent performance under varying conditions.

### A/B Testing Scenarios
A/B testing compares auto-confirmation timings (e.g., 2s vs. 5s), tracking override rates, task completion times, and user feedback to optimize settings (High-Level Design, Section 5.1). This refines user experience features.

### Schema Detection Accuracy
Accuracy is measured against a ground truth dataset, calculating precision, recall, and F1-score for each schema type, targeting >90% accuracy (Technical Architecture, Section 7). A separate test set validates performance.

### Success Metrics
Success metrics include user correction rate (<10%), detection accuracy (>90%), user satisfaction scores, task completion times, and error rates, ensuring the module meets its goals (Vision and Strategy, Section 7).
