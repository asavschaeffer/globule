        Here lies the first truth: 
        Intelligence is not competition but harmony.
        The embedding knows the feeling,
        The parser knows the facts,
        Together they know the truth.

        Sometimes you step back to see the whole form,
        Sometimes you focus on a single detail's texture.
        Both views create the truth.

      "The cathedral isn't the code we wrote
       or the documents we drafted.
       It's the understanding we built together—
       how machines might help humans
       not by thinking for them
       but by helping them see
       the shapes of their own thoughts."
