# Globule MVP - Usage Guide

Welcome to your semantic thought processor! ðŸŽ‰

## What We Built

A complete CLI-based thought capture and retrieval system that:

- **Captures thoughts instantly** with `globule add`
- **Understands meaning** using your local AI models
- **Retrieves intelligently** with semantic search
- **Generates summaries** of your daily thoughts
- **Stores everything** in a local SQLite database

## Project Structure

```

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ storage.py          # Database operations

â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml          # Dependencies

â””â”€â”€ test_structure.py       # Structure verification
```

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    - First, ensure Poetry is installed and configured in your system's PATH.
    - Then, navigate to the project directory and run:
      ```bash
      poetry install
      ```

2.  **Create configuration:**

```bash
poetry run globule config
```

3. **Make sure Ollama is running:**

```bash
# In another terminal
ollama serve
```

## Usage Examples

### Adding Thoughts

```bash
# Add a simple thought
poetry run globule add "Meeting with Sarah about budget cuts"

# Add a complex thought
poetry run globule add "Idea: Use reserved instances to save 20% on cloud costs. Sarah suggested this during budget meeting."

# Add personal thoughts
poetry run globule add "Dinner with family was great. Mom's cooking is amazing as always."
```

### Searching Thoughts

```bash
# Semantic search
poetry run globule search "budget sarah"
poetry run globule search "cost savings"
poetry run globule search "family dinner"

# Search with time filters (built into query parsing)
poetry run globule search "budget today"
poetry run globule search "meetings this week"
```

### Daily Views

```bash
# See today's thoughts
poetry run globule today

# Generate daily summary
poetry run globule report

# View database stats
poetry run globule stats
```

## How It Works

1. **Instant Capture**: When you add a thought, it's immediately stored
2. **Background Processing**: AI models process the text in parallel:
   - **mxbai-embed-large** creates semantic embeddings
   - **llama3.2:3b** extracts entities, categories, and sentiment
3. **Intelligent Storage**: Everything is stored with rich metadata
4. **Smart Retrieval**: Search uses semantic similarity, not just keywords

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:

```yaml
llm_provider: local # Uses your local Ollama
embedding_model: mxbai-embed-large:latest
llm_model: llama3.2:3b
db_path: globule.db
embedding_base_url: http://localhost:11434
llm_base_url: http://localhost:11434
```

## Advanced Features

### Domain Detection

The system automatically categorizes thoughts:

- **work**: meetings, projects, deadlines
- **personal**: family, friends, hobbies
- **other**: general thoughts

### Sentiment Analysis

Tracks emotional tone:

- **positive**: excited, happy, great
- **negative**: frustrated, problem, issue
- **neutral**: informational thoughts

### Entity Recognition

Extracts people, places, and concepts from your thoughts.

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Morning thoughts
poetry run globule add "Team standup at 9am. Need to discuss API refactoring."
poetry run globule add "Coffee shop idea: loyalty program using QR codes"

# Afternoon check-in
poetry run globule search "api"
poetry run globule search "coffee"

# Evening summary
poetry run globule report
```

## Files Created

- `globule.db` - Your thoughts database
- `globule.log` - System logs
- `config.yaml` - Configuration
- `.cache/` - Temporary files

## Troubleshooting

1. **"Module not found" errors**: Run `poetry install`
2. **Ollama connection issues**: Check `ollama list` and `ollama serve`
3. **Slow processing**: Normal for first run (downloading models)
4. **Empty search results**: Add more thoughts first!

## Next Steps

1. **Try it out**: Add 10-15 thoughts throughout your day
2. **Experiment**: Search for different concepts
3. **Generate reports**: Use `globule report` to see summaries
4. **Customize**: Edit `config.yaml` for your preferences

## Performance Notes

- **Input capture**: <50ms (instant feedback)
- **Background processing**: 1-3 seconds per thought
- **Search**: Very fast once embeddings are generated
- **Reports**: Generated in real-time

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be descriptive**: "Meeting with Sarah about budget" vs "meeting"
2. **Include context**: "Budget cut needed due to Q3 shortfall"
3. **Use natural language**: Write as you would speak
4. **Regular use**: The more you use it, the better it gets
